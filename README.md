# awecut

**awecut** (short for *awesome cut*) is a simple and powerful command-line tool to cut TV recordings with precision
‚Äî without reencoding. It‚Äôs built in Rust for speed and reliability, and focuses on making cutting effortless, 
whether you're using manual cue-points or want automated ad detection.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è What It Does/Will do

- Cut TV recordings precisely at cue-points
- No reencoding ‚Äì output is as fast and clean as possible
- Cuts are aligned to keyframes to preserve stream integrity
- Support for automatic ad/commercial detection using multiple methods

## üîç Why awecut?

***Recording your favorite shows is great ‚Äî but watching them with commercials? Not so much.***

**awecut** aims to be the missing link in your TV recording workflow:

- Use it manually with your own cue-points
- Or let it do the work for you by detecting ads using advanced techniques
- Get a clean, reassembled version of your recording in no time

### üîç Why awecut in France?

French television is known to broadcast a lot of contents, including popular movies. I believe 
it is one of the greatest way to create an important library of TV shows, series and movies for free
at the cost of waiting a year after the cinema release and a reduced visual quality (but still better than DVD).
Most of Internet providers enable DRM-free recodings of most TNT-available channels (and obviously all 
contents received by the TNT is DRM-free), you just have to accept the commercials, but not anymore.
